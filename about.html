            <p class="content"> Hi, I am omowonuola. Nice to meet you!!<br>
                As a recent graduate of Geoinformatics, I am excited to begin my career as a GIS Analyst   <br>
                and Developer. I believe a GIS expert should stand with both feets on the ground of the  <br>
                practical world and yet stick their heads in the cloud when they need to. I believe that with   <br>
                the right team you can conquer the world and that success is fulfilling when it can be shared.<br><br>
                I consider myself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on my academic foundation in GIS  <br>
                and stay in tune with the latest trends through continued professional development. I also <br>
                have a knack for community have a knack for community development and currently serve <br>
                as the Mentorship Lead for African Women in GIS, a community for women who work or are  <br>
                interested in the geospatial industry to network, learn, and connect with other women from  <br>
                Africa and in the diaspora. In Africa, there seems to be an absence of a long-standing culture  <br>
                of mentorship and a limited access to some of the types of professional development that are  <br>
                highly valued and more effective. Our mission is to create a platform where access to the right  <br>
                training is made possible for our mentees (who are mainly students and early-career professionals<br>
                early-career professionals) to support and enhance them as they continue on a trajectoryof sucess.<br>
